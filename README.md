## The Hilbert Projection Theorem. Some Applications in Statistical Estimation and Time Series Forecasting.

### Abstract 

This thesis focuses on the Projection Theorem in the context of Hilbert spaces and how it can be extended to the field of statistical estimation and time series forecasting. The projection theorem is a mathematical result which guarantees that, under some conditions, an element (i.e. a point) belonging to a Hilbert space can be projected onto a closed subspace or a closed and convex subset in a way that the distance between the element and the surface onto which it is projected is minimized. Depending on the surface where the element is projected, the projection will present some peculiarities, which will be studied in detail. 

In the world of statistics and forecasting, this theorem allows us to state that the minimum variance estimator for the parameters of a regression model will exist and be unique if some conditions are satisfied. Finally, the paper also deals with the connection between the conditional expectation and the best linear prediction using the result and implications of the projection theorem.
